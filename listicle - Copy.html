          Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has already received a lot of buzz in the past decade,
          but it continues to be one of the new technology trends because of its notable effects on how we live, 
          work and play are only in the early stages. AI is already known for its superiority in image and speech recognition, navigation apps, 
          smartphone personal assistants, ride-sharing apps and so much more.

        <p class="text">
          Like AI and Machine Learning, Robotic Process Automation, or RPA, is another technology that is automating jobs.
           RPA is the use of software to automate business processes such as interpreting applications, processing transactions, dealing with data, and even replying to emails. 
           RPA automates repetitive tasks that people used to do.

        <div class="line-space"> </div>
        <p class="text">
          Formerly a new technology trend to watch, cloud computing has become mainstream, with major players AWS (Amazon Web Services),
           Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform dominating the market. The adoption of cloud computing is still growing, as more and more businesses migrate to a cloud solution.
            But it’s no longer the emerging technology trend. Edge is.Edge computing is designed to help solve some of those problems as a way to bypass the latency caused by cloud computing and getting data to a data center for processing.
             It can exist “on the edge,” if you will, closer to where computing needs to happen. For this reason, edge computing can be used to process time-sensitive data in remote locations with limited or no connectivity to a centralized location. 
             In those situations, edge computing can act like mini datacenters.

        <div class="line-space"> </div>
        <p class="text">
          Next remarkable technology trend is quantum computing, which is a form of computing that takes advantage of quantum phenomena like superposition and quantum entanglement.
           This amazing technology trend is also involved in preventing the spread of the coronavirus, and to develop potential vaccines, thanks to its ability to easily query, monitor, analyze and act on data, regardless of the source.
            Another field where quantum computing is finding applications is banking and finance, to manage credit risk, for high-frequency trading and fraud detection.
